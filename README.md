# Audio Image

This simple program shows the left and right channels of a WAV file
as separate axes. The left audio channel is represented by the axis
pointing to the top-left. The right audio channel is represented by
the axis pointing to the top-right. Resonance between the channels
creates interesting patterns.

### Program Arguments
1. Path to WAV file to display and play (required)
2. Number of seconds to delay before starting (optional; default = 1)

### WAV file requirements

This has only been tested on a WAV file generated by Audacity
with the setting `WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM`.
